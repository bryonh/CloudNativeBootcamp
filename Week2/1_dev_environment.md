# Setting up a Dev Environment from Start to Finish

- Michael Levan guides us through the installation and configuration of VS Code
- For these labs, we will be using Python and PowerShell, so we'll need to install some extensions
- I have VS Code installed already and the extensions he mentions, so I'll mark this one **completed**.
- I still don't have access to GitHub Codespaces. I'm on the waiting list.
