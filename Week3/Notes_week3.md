# Infrastructure as Code

## Core practices of IaC

- Everything defined as code
  - Reusability
  - Consistency
  - Transparency
- **Validation and testing** (just as important as testing code)
- Small and simple parts that you can change independently
  - You want your code to be as simple as possible

## Configuration management vs infrastructure provisioning

- Configuration management: Terraform
- Infrastructure provisioning: Chef, Puppet, Ansible
- With the growth of microservices and serverless

## Where do I start?

- Automate one thing at a time and start slow
- DevOps culture is about making small changes, one at a time, and improve upon them
- Don't try to do all at once
- Automate the most tedious processes first, like server builds
- **If you try to do everything at once, you'll most likely have to go back and redo it**
