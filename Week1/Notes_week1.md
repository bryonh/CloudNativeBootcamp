# DevOps Fundamental Skills

### Introduction

The most important thing: **DON'T PANIC**:exclamation::exclamation:

[Michael Levan](https://github.com/AdminTurnedDevOps) gives us an overview of predictions for 2021 and core DevOps concepts and skills.

## DevOps Predictions for 2021

- Culture and leadership
    - Organizations are starting to value the DevOps culture more and more
    - The ability to have multiple teams working together
    - We all need to find ways to communicate more
    - **Collaboration**
- Hybrid teams
    - Remote teams are the norm now
- Application security
    - Security is, unfortunatelly, an afterthought most of the times
    - Security must be at the forefront of every deployment decision
- Cloud adoption
    - The public cloud is expected to grow
- **DevOps is for the business**
    - DevOps is very much a business position, not simply an engineering one
    - Without DevOps there wouldn't be a business
    - The DevOps pro is a key stakeholder in the organization
- Developers will have more say
- DevOps is still one of the more increasingly needed roles

DevOps, as a position, has been around for a few years.

## Cloud Computing

- You are using resources that you don't own
- Microsoft or Amazon, or other cloud vendors, own the resources
- Renting of resources
- High availability
- Scalability
- Quick deployments

## Collaboration

- Communication
    - The ability to communicate with your team is crucial
    - A constant line of communication has to exist
- Working together
    - With good communication comes good ideas
    - With good ideas come good theories
    - With good theories come good products
- Working with management
    - The only way for a team to succeed
    - Management and engineers must be on the same page
- Working with other teams
    - It's all about communication and collaboration
- Goals should be aligned

## Working with the Business

- Management and engineering should always be on the same page
- Know when to say NO
- When you're in engineering, it's easy not to think about the business' goals and objectives
- Your own goals and the business goals must align

## Major DevOps Tooling
<br>

![DevOps Tools](devops-tools.png)

- Coding and development practices
    - Azure: most popular are PowerShell, Python and JavaScript
    - AWS: most popular are Python, JavaScript, Java and Go
- Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Containerization (Docker, containerd, CRI-O)
    - Azure has its own containerization platform: Azure Container Instances (ACI)
    - In AWS, there are AWS Elastic Container Services and AWS Fargate
- Monitoring
    - Azure: Application Insights, Azure Monitor, Prometheus
    - AWS: Cloud Watch, Lambda Insights, Prometheus
- Cloud
- CI/CD
- Infrastructure-as-code

## Security Skills

- You don't have to be a hacker, but you have to have an understanding of software and development security skills
- Start thinking about security from the application perspective
- Faster deployments == more vulnerability
    - Many CI/CDs pipelines aren't checking for security vulnerabilities
- Core software security competencies
    - Static code analysis
    - Unit testing
    - Performance testing
    - **These tests should always be in the CI portion of your pipeline**

## Command Line (CLI)

- **You should be a command line wizard**
- A CLI tool is just a middle-man to an API
- Much quicker

## Version/Source Control

- A place to store code
- Version control == manage versions
- **Collaboration**
- Less bugs
- Code reviews
- The more eyes on the code the better
- Everyone is aware
- Centralized version control
    - One server
    - everyone uses the code from this one server
    - Very hard to collaborate
- Distributed version control
    - Most popular today
    - Allows anyone to download and have a working copy of the code on their local hosts, typically referred to as a local repo
    - Allows multiple people to work with the code at the same time

## CI/CD

- Build, test and create an artifact out of the code to be used in a deployment
- Deploy the code simply with the click of a button or as the code is committed to a repo
- Continuous Delivery: allows you to automatically deploy code daily, weekly, hourly, etc.
- Continuous Deployment: auto-deploy

## Guiding Principles & Winning Patterns :bulb:

1. Strategic empathy
