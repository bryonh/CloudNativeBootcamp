# Setting up your first AWS environment

In this project, I'll create an AWS account.

I didn't have one, so I followed the steps on the video and created my own account.

Next steps:

1. Read the [AWS Fundamentals](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/fundamentals-core-concepts/) documentation
1. Watch the [AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLmDS179YE&ab&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
1. Try a few [hands-on tutorials](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/?awsf.getting-started-content-type=content-type%23hands-on&?e=gs2020&p=gsrc)
