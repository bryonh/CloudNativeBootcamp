# Artifacts and Packages in CI/CD

- An artifact is a package of code.

## The Project

- For this project, we're gonna create an artifact in Azure DevOps from the previous build we used for [Project 4](4_Setting_Up_Continuous_Monitoring.md).
- In Azure DevOps, we can create an artifact from a build we already built inside Azure DevOps, or from code stored in Azure Repos, GitHub or TFVC.
- I built an artifact from the resulting build of the Parts Unlimited web app.
